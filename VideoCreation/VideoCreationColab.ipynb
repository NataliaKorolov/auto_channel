        "\n",
        "### Common Issues and Solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "**❌ \"File not found\" errors:**\n",
        "- Make sure you've uploaded all required files\n",
        "- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)\n",
        "- Use `list_uploaded_files(TT_DIRECTORY)` to see uploaded files\n",
        "\n",
        "**❌ \"Out of memory\" errors:**\n",
        "- Try smaller video files or shorter audio clips\n",
        "- Process videos one at a time instead of batch processing\n",
        "- Restart runtime if needed: Runtime → Restart runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "**❌ \"Audio/video sync issues\":**\n",
        "- Ensure audio duration matches or is shorter than video content\n",
        "- Use `use_audio_duration=True` in video creation functions\n",
        "\n",
        "**❌ \"Text overlay not visible\":**\n",
        "- Adjust `horizontal_offset` and `vertical_offset` values (1-100)\n",
        "- Try different colors: white text with black stroke usually works\n",
        "- Increase `font_size` for better visibility\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "- **File sizes**: Keep video files under 100MB each for best performance\n",
        "- **Audio quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV or 320kbps MP3 recommended\n",
        "- **Video format**: MP4 with H.264 codec works best\n",
        "- **Batch processing**: Process multiple videos sequentially, not in parallel\n",
        "\n",
        "### File Format Support\n",
        "\n",
        "**Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV\n",
        "**Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC  \n",
        "**Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP\n",
        "**Data**: CSV, Excel (XLSX, XLS)\n",
